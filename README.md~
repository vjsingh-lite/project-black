Project Black
========

Project Black is a web application meant to assist people who are physically challenged by sight.

The project isn't complete yet. Currently I use google's tts but since it has limited access I get blocked after a few requests, so I used multiple free webservers as proxies for google's tts. The proxies do not work anymore so I am trying to find a tts engine suitable for the project. I also have plans for developing an android app.
Currently I am working on a chrome app for project black because the chrome tts is best suited for this project.
