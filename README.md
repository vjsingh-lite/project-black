Project Black
========

Project Black is a web application meant to assist people who are physically challenged by sight.

The project isn't complete. When I made this, I used google's tts but since it has limited access I got blocked after a few requests, so I used multiple free webservers as proxies for google's tts. The proxies stopped working so I was in the midst of trying to find a tts engine suitable for the project. I also had plans for developing an android app.
I was also working on a chrome app for project black because chrome tts is best suited for this project.
